# platziWalletApp

Project developed during the **Android design patterns course by Platzi** which explores the most used design patterns in each one of the categories:
- Creational patterns: Singleton, Builder, Factory
- Structural patterns: Adapter, Proxy, Facade
- Behavioral patterns: Observer, Command

The platzi wallet app developed under MVP architecture applies the patterns described previously. The app allows users to simulate a wallet to send and receive money.
